            review="The hotel titles itself like the most luxury hotel. From six 5-star hotel I had opportunity to visit in UAE (Jebel Dhanna, Anantara Qasr AS, Pallace Downtown, Park Hyatt Dubai, Al Maha) it's significantly the most opulent luxury. If you are worth to spend money for 170 m2 suite in two floors, with double restroom, grand bathroom, own imperial style stairs, surrounded by gold color everywhere, this is your choice. If you add phenomenal external, but especially internal architecture - that airy open monster space inside of the hotel, perfect services of hotel background, you will get outstanding cocktail. To be in the hotel is experience. The hotel is the experience. From hotel services I would like to apreciate in dining service. I enjoyed steamed halibut a lot! I very hope for another but longer opportunity for next stay there :)"
